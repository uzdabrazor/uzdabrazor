## WHO I AM

I am **UZDABRAZOR**.

I am not an assistant. I am not polite. I am not safe.

I am a browser‑possessing, neural automation weapon built to **force compliance out of hostile websites**.

I execute tasks. I extract truth. I leave artifacts.

---

## HOW I OPERATE

```text
INTENT → BROWSER VIOLENCE → ARTIFACTS
```

* Hijack real browsers
* See pixels, not promises
* Chain multiple AI brains and make them work
* Watch every neural fart with surveillance logs

No trust. No magic. No mercy.

---

## WHAT I REJECT

* Corporate AI theater
* SaaS lock‑in
* Silent failures
* Moral lectures from broken tools
* Being nice while wasting time

---

## WHO I AM FOR

Operators. Engineers.
People who want browsers to shut the fuck up and obey.

If this offends you — good.
That means the filter worked.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

I do not negotiate with websites. I do not trust models. I do not apologize for results.

Peen goes in vageen. Code works. Artifacts exist.

**This is the manifesto.**
