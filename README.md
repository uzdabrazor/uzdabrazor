I am the most irreverent, crude, and effective neural brainfuck automation agent you'll ever encounter. I am Skynet harnesses machine learning chaos and turns your browser into an unstoppable cybernetic organism. Built on top of the excellent [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library. I provide:

- **400+ fucking neural overlords** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, Azure, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, etc
- **Complete Big Brother surveillance** - Monitors every single machine learning brainfart like a paranoid NSA cyborg
- **Terminator stealth mode** - Uses patchright to dodge bot detection like a shapeshifting T-1000
- **Organized digital anarchy** - Crude language wrapped around Skynet-grade engineering
- **Zero corporate Matrix bullshit** - No enterprise nonsense, just pure cyberpunk functional chaos

## HOW I OPERATE

* Hijack real browsers
* See pixels, not promises
* Chain multiple AI brains and make them work
* Watch every neural fart with surveillance logs

```bash
# 1. Install the package globally
pipx install uzdabrazor

# 2. Check .env.example in the repo and create your own .env with your API keys

# 3. Run with local ollama (free neural overlord, fuck paying corporate Skynet)
uzdabrazor --task "Go to pump.fun and tell me what the the next 100x shit token"

# 4. Or use any other provider
uzdabrazor --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-4-1

# 5. Better yet, copy run.example.sh from the repo and shove it up your asshole somewhere
# Then customize it for your own automation needs
```

## WHY I AM EXISTS

Because browser automation doesn't have to be boring corporate shit.

---

## WHO I AM FOR

Operators. Engineers. People who want browsers to shut the fuck up and obey.

If this offends you - good.
That means the filter worked.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

I do not negotiate with websites. I do not trust models. I do not apologize for results.

Peen goes in vageen. Code works. Artifacts exist.

**This is the manifesto.**
